Modelling of Dispersion of Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5 from Stationary Sources in the Air
Particulate matter of 10 microns diameter (PM10) as well as 2.5 microns (PM2.5) are among the most important air pollutants and one of the most harmful to public health. This research aims to study the modelling of dispersion of particulate matter emitted from stationary sources such as power plants and oil refineries, using mathematical modeling. The study was applied to Baniyas city using the Ermak analytical model in MATLAB environment in order to model the dispersion of PM10 and PM2.5 in the vicinity of the power plant and Baniyas oil refinery. To apply the model, available data on wind speed and directions, in addition to the quantity and specifications of the used fuel and stacks were used. Four scenarios were analyzed as the most common cases: moderate wind speed, low wind speed that carries pollution to Banyas city, in addition to the assumption that the smoke cloud had reached its effective height or not due to weather and operational conditions. The results showed that the largest amount of particulate matter was deposited at ground level, near the stacks at concentrations exceeding the daily average of exposure specified by the World Health Organization, while these concentrations exceeded the recommended annual averages over an area of approximately two square kilometers positioned following the direction of prevailing winds and at maximum concentrations that vary according to the applied scenario. 
Key words: Air pollution modeling, PM10, PM2,5, Power plants, oil refinery.
